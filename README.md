#Timelapse Photography

##Take pictures using Python

On the morning of June 14th 2014, I was taking part in Blackpool Makerspace meeting and thought it would be great to enable a method to take pics from our meetings.

As our Raspberry Pi was already in use, I searched around and found an easy to use method involving pygame, so I quickly adapted the code to be called via a function.

I used a Microsoft LifeCam HD webcam, but at this time I can only get 640x480 resolution from the camera.

To use this code you will need the pygame library installed.

Enjoy
